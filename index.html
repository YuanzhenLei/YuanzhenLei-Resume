        <p class="lead mb-4">2020-current: I am a junior student studying Psychology at University of California, Riverside in Riverside, CA. Courses that I have taken at University of California, Riverside: Introductory Psychology, Industrial/Organizational Psychology, The Violent Universe, Introduction To Computing, Psychological Methods: Statistical Procedures, And The Brain And Behavior.
2017-2020: I have studied at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, CA. I graduated with Associate in Arts degrees in Natural Sciences, Psychology, and Social & Behavioral Sciences.
2015-2017: I have studies and graduated from Xiamen Foreign Language School in Xiamen, China with a high school degree.
<br><br>

        I was born and grown in Xiamen, China until I was eighteen years old. I have started studying abroad in the United State since 2017. Based on my personal experience, I am able to speak and write Simplified Chinese and English since I have taken education in both Chinese and English from schools in China. I am proficient in using office software since it was taught in schools. I prefer Chinese food than western food, so I usually cook in my home by myself, and I am able to cook simple Chines food. I like recording introduction videos about video games. My videos focus more on video games on personal computer, but I currently started recording video games on consoles. Because of my experience of uploading videos, I am proficient in using pictures, audios, and videos editing software. I am also familiar with social media as I have managed video channel and other accounts since 2013. I am a cat lover and have had two cats for three years. I am familiar with catâ€™ habits and characteristics, and I am proficient in taking care of cats.<br><br>

        I have a passion to continue studying in Psychology field, and I have wide hobbies in
different areas. In this case, I can think things widely, and I have the ability to adapt to different environments and do well in different situations. I have learned how to edit videos by self- learning, and my process of learning editing videos can show my ability to solve problems. When I just started uploading videos about computer games, I noticed that I didnâ€™t have many audiences. After watching many other popular videos, I realize that my videos lacked good editing. As a teenager without economic sources, I decided to learn how to make a video by myself. I have watched many teaching videos and videos with good ideas for editing to enhance my skill and aesthetic. I saved pocket-money to buy video editing software, and I spent most of my leisure in making videos. Since 2013, I have more than seventy videos and more than one hundred thousand views counts. I donâ€™t have a lot of view counts, but I never stop my education since I was in middle school. After I was encouraged in Psychology courses in my college, I have considered making videos about mental health. Most of my videos are in a Chinese video website, and I know that most teenagers and young people in China have issues in mental health, but the situation is that mental health is not a common topic as physical health in China. The website I upload video has audiences that most are young people, so I can make videos to encourage people to value mental health. My hobby and major can be connected, and I can focus my studies on young peopleâ€™s mental health in my major studying. Moreover, my videos can help people to pay attention to their mental health.
